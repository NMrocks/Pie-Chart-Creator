# Pie-Chart-Creator

A Python program which creates a pie chart using MatPlotLib and has a GUI created using Tkinter. Feel free to copy and use my code anywhere, just don't forget to credit me!

I would like to thank Ghanteyyy (http://github.com/ghanteyyy) for contributing to this project. This program wouldn't have been so nice without his efforts.

**Important Note**

This program will not work unless `PCC logo.png`, `instructions.txt`, `icon.ico` and `pie_chart_creator.py` are in the same folder on your device.
