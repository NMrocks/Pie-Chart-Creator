# Pie-Chart-Creator

A Python program which creates a pie chart using MatPlotLib and has a GUI created using Tkinter. Feel free to copy and use my code anywhere, just don't forget to credit me!

I would like to thank Ghanteyyy (http://github.com/ghanteyyy) for contributing to this project. This program wouldn't have been so nice without his efforts.

**Important Note**

This program will not work unless `pie_chart_creator.py` and the `included_files` folder are in the same folder on your device.
